# First-and-Last-Occurence-of-Element

Task details

You are Given an array Sorted in ascending order. Find the Starting and ending Position of a given Target value.



If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].



You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

Output: [3,4]



Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,10], target = 8

Output: [3,8]



Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6

Output: [-1,-1]





Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
nums is a non-decreasing array.
-109 <= target <= 109
